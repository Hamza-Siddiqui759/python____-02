Whatâ€™s better than stories to inculcate moral values in children happily? Stories, at bedtime or during the day, are a great way of bonding with children and teaching them lessons. But how does the bonding happen? Well, when we recite stories to children in a way they understand (*we mean by making faces and cute sounds*), they start developing the habit of listening to their parents, which in later years, helps a lot. Fables like the â€˜Thirst Crowâ€™ story in English are short and easy to understand for children that send profound lessons.
